<!--
This wave is where we will introduce the view layer to interact with
our application via the browser.

Set up necessary controller(s) and route(s) that you will need in order
to show a task from the database
Create a root route for your application that directs users to the list
of all tasks
Each task name in the list should link to a show action that will render
a new view for the user.
The show view should include the complete information about the task:
name, description, completion status, and completion date.
All markup in all views should have semantic relevance.
-->

<h1>
    <%= @task.title.capitalize %>
</h1>

<ul>
  <li>
    <strong>Description:</strong> <%= @task.description %>
  </li>

  <li>
    <strong>Date completed:</strong>
    <% if @task.completed_at == nil %>
      not yet completed
    <% else %>
      <%= @task.completed_at.strftime("%B %e, %Y (%I:%M:%S %p)") %>
     <% end %>
  </li>
</ul>

  <%= link_to "Home",  root_path %>
